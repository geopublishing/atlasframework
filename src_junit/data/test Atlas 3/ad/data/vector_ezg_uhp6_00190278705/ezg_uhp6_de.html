<u>Delineation of sub-catchments</u><br>
The sub-catchments were delineated with the Hydro-Tool extension of ArcGIS 9.0 based on the digital elevation model (DEM) 
of the SRTM mission. The Hydro-Tool uses the D8-method to derive the flow direction from the DTM. <br>
The resolution of the SRTM-DEM is 90 m x 90 m.<br>
<br>
<u>Discharge of gauged catchments</u><br>
The discharge measurements are based on water level measurements and a stage-discharge-relationship, which was determined 
by the CATCH-Project and the ‘Direction Générale de l’Hydraulique’ (DGH) for each gauge performing discharge measurements 
at different water levels. The measured discharge of the considered catchments serve as data base for model validation 
(See page: HVO-D-02 “Hydrologic Modelling in the Upper Ouémé Catchment”). The delineated sub-catchments are from 400 km² 
(Aguimo) to 10000 km² (Ouémé Bétérou). <br>
