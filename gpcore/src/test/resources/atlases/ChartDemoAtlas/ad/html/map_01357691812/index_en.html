      The term <b>digital divide</b>&#160;refers to the gap between people with 
      effective access to <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital" title="Digital">digital</a>&#160;
      and <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">information 
      technology</a>&#160;and those with very limited or no access at all. It 
      includes the imbalances in physical access to <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology" title="Technology">technology</a>&#160;
      &#160;as well as the imbalances in resources and skills needed to effectively 
      participate as a <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen" title="Digital citizen">digital 
      citizen</a>. In other words, it is the unequal access by some members of <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>&#160;
      &#160;to information and communication technology, and the unequal 
      acquisition of related skills. The term is closely related to the <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_divide" title="Knowledge divide">knowledge 
      divide</a>&#160;as the lack of technology causes lack of useful information 
      and knowledge. The digital divide may be classified based on <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>,

      &#160;groups, and by locations. The term <a href="browser://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_digital_divide" title="Global digital divide">global 
      digital divide</a>&#160;refers to differences in technology access between 
      countries or the whole world.

    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the 21st century, the emergence of the <a href="/wiki/Knowledge_society" title="Knowledge society">knowledge 
      society</a>&#160;becomes pervasive. The transformations of world&#8217;s economy 
      and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and 
      communication technologies (<a href="/wiki/Information_technology" title="Information technology">ICT</a>) 
      these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy. In 
      order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people 
      need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become 
      essential for all societies.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Knowledge divide is related with digital divide
    </h2>
    <p>
      The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very 
      important. This is why digitization is viewed closely related to 
      knowledge. Scientists generally agree that there is a <a browser="#DEFAULT" href="">
</a>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide&quot; title=&quot;Digital 
      divide&quot;&gt;digital divide, recently different reports also showed the 
      existence of knowledge divide.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the one hand, the existence of knowledge is more and more related 
      with the development of an ICT infrastructure. Without ICT, it is 
      impossible to have an infrastructure able to process automatically the 
      huge flow of information that is required in an advanced economy. In 
      particular, without an adequate technical support, e-learning and 
      electronic documents are impossible to be developed, in order to 
      overcome time and space constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      One the other hand, knowledge is distinct from ICT and its physical 
      support of information. According to the UNESCO's report from 2005, 
      knowledge is related also with many other aspects outside ICT world such 
      as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Freedom
      </li>
      <li>
        Democracy
      </li>
      <li>
        Plurality of information
      </li>
      <li>
        The infrastructure of economy
      </li>
      <li>
        The existence of a successful educational process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For instance, a poor grid of electricity makes less probable the 
      existence of computer networks or the existence of higher education 
      institutions. The absence of freedom might diminish or delay the 
      pursuits of acquiring new knowledge. Also, the poor development of 
      educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people 
      belonging to that society.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Knowledge divide in gender, race, ethnicity and social class
    </h2>
    <p>
      First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the North 
      and the South (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of 
      knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also 
      on the development of education in these countries. If a country has 
      attained higher literacy level then this will result in having higher 
      level of knowledge. Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues 
      in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a 
      knowledge divide in respect to

        Race
