the emergence of the <a title="Knowledge society" href="&#47;wiki&#47;Knowledge_society">knowledge        society</a>&nbsp;becomes pervasive&#46; The transformations of world&rsquo;s economy        and of each society have a fast pace&#46; Together with information and        communication technologies (<a title="Information technology" href="&#47;wiki&#47;Information_technology">ICT</a>)        these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy&#46; In        order to keep pace with innovations&#44; to come up with new ideas&#44; people        need to produce and manage knowledge&#46; This is why knowledge has become        essential for all societies&#46;</p>  <h2>Knowledge divide is related with digital divide</h2>  <p>The information and ICT systems that support knowledge are very        important&#46; This is why digitization is viewed closely related to        knowledge&#46; Scientists generally agree that there is a http:&#47;&#47;en&#46;wikipedia&#46;org&#47;wiki&#47;Digital_divide&quot; title&#61;&quot;Digital        divide&quot;&gt;digital divide&#44; recently different reports also showed the        existence of knowledge divide&#46;</p>  <p>On the one hand&#44; the existence of knowledge is more and more related        with the development of an ICT infrastructure&#46; Without ICT&#44; it is        impossible to have an infrastructure able to process automatically the        huge flow of information that is required in an advanced economy&#46; In        particular&#44; without an adequate technical support&#44; e-learning and        electronic documents are impossible to be developed&#44; in order to        overcome time and space constraints&#46;</p>  <p>One the other hand&#44; knowledge is distinct from ICT and its physical        support of information&#46; According to the UNESCO&#39;s report from 2005&#44;        knowledge is related also with many other aspects outside ICT world such        as:</p>  <ul>      <li>Freedom</li>      <li>Democracy</li>      <li>Plurality of information</li>      <li>The infrastructure of economy</li>      <li>The existence of a successful educational process&#46;</li>  </ul>  <p>For instance&#44; a poor grid of electricity makes less probable the        existence of computer networks or the existence of higher education        institutions&#46; The absence of freedom might diminish or delay the        pursuits of acquiring new knowledge&#46; Also&#44; the poor development of        educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people        belonging to that society&#46;</p>  <h2>Knowledge divide in gender&#44; race&#44; ethnicity and social class</h2>  <p>First&#44; it was noticed that a great difference exists between the North        and the South (rich countries vs&#46; poor countries)&#46; The development of        knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also        on the development of education in these countries&#46; If a country has        attained higher literacy level then this will result in having higher        level of knowledge&#46; Indeed&#44; UNESCO&#39;s report details many social issues        in knowledge divide related to globalization&#46; There was noticed a        knowledge divide in respect to</p>  <ul>      <li>Gender</li>      <li>Race</li>      <li>Ethnicity</li>      <li>Social class</li>  </ul>  <a href="pdf://pdf_00320581851_mini">mini.pdf</a></body></html>
